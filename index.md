## Flow Overview <a name="flow-overview"></a>
Our solution implements all the crucial steps, which are: 
* Calculating the price of our product for a specific car rental offer
* Receiving a payment from a customer (incl. some prepay amount for a car rental)
* Identification and verification of a customer
* Communicating with your system via API regarding the status of verification/approval process

These steps will be described in the following sections from the points of view of a customer and your system.

### Customer Experience  <a name="customers-pov"></a>

A customer may browse our partner car rental company’s web site for a specified time interval. When they open a detailed view of a rental offer, they find a section with additional services which includes our product Deposit Free and its price. If a customer chooses to use our solution and proceeds to book, they get redirected to our Customer Flow page where they:
* pay for an order 
* upload their ID document. 

After completion of these steps the order undergoes the approval process which includes KYC procedure. 

When the decision is made to either approve or reject the order, the corresponding email will be sent to the customer. 

In case of approval, the customer will also receive an issued guarantee agreement. 

In case of rejection, we will unblock the money on the customer’s payment card within 24 hours.

### Your System Routine <a name="your-systems-pov"></a>
Your system creates the list of additional services for a specific car rental offer. To get a price for Cardoo’s Deposit Free your system has to make the price request to our system.

When a customer chooses our solution and starts the booking process, your system will need to make an order creation request to our system and in response it will get an URL to the Customer Flow. Your system will redirect the customer to that URL instead of your usual payment page.

After our order approval process has been completed, your system will receive a signal which will not contain the actual decision. Upon receiving that signal your system should make a request to our system to get our decision. 

## Testing Guideline <a name="testing-guideline"></a>
Please use the sandbox mode to test integrations.
There are a few key differences from the production mode:
- No real bank card will be accepted, please use a test card data. 
- Automatic customer identification and verification process is not available, but you can still experience this part of the process interacting as a customer.
- You will have to manually issue or deny the Guarantee (this is available only in the sandbox mode). 

To use the sandbox mode, please, use the following URL to send HTTP requests: <https://sandbox-api.cardoo.finance>

### Bank Payment Card Test Data
You can enter the following payment card details on the payment page of our Customer Flow in order to successfully pay:

**Bank card number**: 4111 1111 1111 1111

**Expiry date, MM/YY**: any date later or equal to the present

**CSC/CVV**: 000

**Card holder name**: any combination of English letters and spaces


### Issuing or Denying the Guarantee

**Note** Described API endpoints are only available in Sandbox.

#### POST /partner_api/sandbox/orders/:order_id/guarantee_issuance/issue
For emulating issuance of the guarantee by Cardoo, send a POST request with empty body to this URL.

When the guarantee issuance status has been successfully changed to "issued", the response would have status `200 OK` and an empty body. This would also trigger callback `guarantee_status_changed`, if you have specified it.


#### POST /partner_api/sandbox/orders/:order_id/guarantee_issuance/deny
For emulating denial of the guarantee issuance by Cardoo, send a POST request with empty body to this URL.

When the guarantee issuance status has been successfully changed to "denied", the response would have status `200 OK` and an empty body. This would also trigger callback `guarantee_status_changed`, if you have specified it.



# API Reference <a name="api-reference"></a>
## Overview  <a name="api-overview"></a>
The Cardoo API allows you to manage orders and request prices for our products in a simple way using conventional HTTP requests.

#### Requests
All requests should be made using the HTTPS protocol so that traffic is encrypted.

When passing parameters in a POST request, parameters must be passed as a JSON object containing attribute names and values as key-value pairs. You must also set `Content-Type` header to `application/json`.

#### Authentication
All requests to Cardoo API must be authenticated.

In order to make an authenticated request, please include a header containing your token as follows: `Access-Token: YOUR_TOKEN`.

To receive the access token, please, contact us via <sales@cardoo.finance>. 

#### Responses
In general, if the status of the response is in the 200 range, it indicates that the request was fulfilled successfully and no error was encountered.

Return codes in the 400 range indicate some issue with the request that was sent. This could mean that you did not authenticate, or an object with given attributes could not be created.

A response status in 500 range indicates a server-side problem.

#### Error Objects
When you get a response in 400 range, it will contain an error object with code and a message:

```json
{
  "status": 422,
  "message": "Deposit amount has to be greater than zero"
}
```

#### Date and Time Values
Date and time values must be formatted according ISO 8601.

#### Money Object

Monetary values are represented as an object with value in cents and currency in ISO format. For example, 11.54 euros must be passed as 1154 cents:

```json
{
  "cents": 1154,
  "currency_iso": "eur"
}
```

### POST /partner_api/orders/onetime/deposit_free_price_request
